<u> .nc file </u>
.nc (NetCDF - Network Common Data Form) files store multi-dimensional scientific data like time, latitude, longitude, and pollutant levels.
Data is stored in grids with labeled dimensions and attributes, making it ideal for atmospheric and geospatial analysis.

Differences between Level-2 (L2) and Level-3 (L3) satellite data
L2: Raw, pixel-level data with minimal processing.
L3: Gridded, processed data ready for analysis.

Why is L2 data converted to L3 in this project, and how does this affect processing?
L3 data simplifies analysis by filtering noise and aligning spatial/temporal grids, reducing computational complexity.
